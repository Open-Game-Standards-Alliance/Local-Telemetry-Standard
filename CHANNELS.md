# Common Channels Annex

Status: informative annex to the OGSA-TS v1 schema. Channel names are *data*
carried in `ChannelDescriptor` — this annex has no schema or wire-format
impact. It ratifies well-known channel names **with required units** so
receivers can auto-map telemetry across games without per-game
configuration.

## Units

Channel units follow [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) C-3: SI base units
plus a closed whitelist of declared exceptions — `degC` (temperature),
`rpm` (rotational speed). Angles are always `rad`. Never degrees,
`km/h`, `kt`, `bar`, or `psi`; senders convert at the source.

## For senders

- If a channel's concept matches a ratified name below, use the ratified
  name, type, and unit exactly (`engine.rpm` is `rpm` and a number).
- You MUST NOT reuse a ratified name with a different unit — that is a
  different channel; give it your own name.
- Concepts not covered: name freely (`boat.anchorDepth`, `mech.reactorHeat`).
  Anything recurring may be ratified later (see below).

## For receivers

Match **exactly** on the ratified name — never fuzzy-match or substring-match
ratified names. A channel whose name+unit match an annex entry can be bound
with zero configuration. For everything else, fall back to per-game profiles.
Discovery always carries the sender's name and unit, so this annex is a
semantic convenience, never a dependency.

## Naming conventions (families — not ratified entries)

Some channel families recur across domains without single fixed semantics.
Use these prefixes so receivers can group them; individual names remain
free-form until a specific entry is ratified:

- `ctrl.*` — control-surface / control-input deflections: `ctrl.aileron`,
  `ctrl.elevator`, `ctrl.rudder` (−1..1), `ctrl.flaps`, `ctrl.spoilers`
  (0..1), `gear.down` (boolean). Signs follow CONVENTIONS C-5: a positive
  input produces the positive rotation about the matching body axis
  (`ctrl.elevator` + = nose-up, `ctrl.rudder` + = nose-right,
  `ctrl.aileron` + = roll right-down, `ctrl.steering.angle` + = right;
  the last is the handwheel — the road wheel's own angle is schema
  `steerAngle`, C-6).
- `wind.*` — per-tick wind: `wind.trueSpeed` / `wind.apparentSpeed` (m/s),
  `wind.trueDirection` / `wind.apparentAngle` (rad). Direction follows the
  meteorological **from** convention in the world frame; apparent angle is
  relative to the nose, positive = from the right (CONVENTIONS C-7);
  vector channels `wind.x/y/z` point toward where the air moves.
  Wind changes per gust, so it rides motion-frame channels — never the
  discovery-static `environment`.
- `air.*` — air data: `air.trueAirspeed`, `air.indicatedAirspeed` (m/s),
  `air.aoa` (rad), `air.mach`.

These families are annex candidates once naming stabilizes across ≥2 games
(`air.*` and `ctrl.*` already qualify on MSFS/X-Plane/DCS evidence).

## Ratification rules

1. The concept must exist in at least **two shipping games** (or clear
   equivalents across domains — e.g. `engine.rpm` for a car and a boat's
   propeller shaft).
2. Additions are pull requests to this file; OGSA reviews for name quality
   (lowercase, dotted hierarchy), unit sanity, and non-overlap.
3. Entries are never renamed or re-united — corrections supersede by adding
   a new name and noting the deprecation inline.

## Ratified channels (v1)

| Name | Type | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `engine.rpm` | number | `rpm` | Crankshaft / shaft revolutions per minute |
| `engine.throttle` | number | — | Driver throttle input, 0..1 (C-3) |
| `engine.torque` | number | `Nm` | Current engine output torque |
| `engine.temperature` | number | `degC` | Coolant / motor temperature |
| `engine.running` | boolean | — | Engine/motor currently producing power |
| `transmission.gear` | number | — | −1 reverse, 0 neutral, 1…n forward |
| `vehicle.speed` | number | `m/s` | Speed over ground (display conversions are the receiver's job) |
| `brakes.pedal` | number | — | Driver brake input, 0..1 (C-3) |
| `brakes.pressure` | number | `Pa` | Master cylinder brake pressure |
| `ctrl.steering.angle` | number | `rad` | Handwheel angle, + = right (C-4); the road wheel's own angle is schema `steerAngle` (C-6) |
| `input.clutch` | number | — | Driver clutch input, 0..1 (C-3) |
| `lights.headlights` | boolean | — | Headlights on |
| `lights.highBeam` | boolean | — | High beams on |
| `lights.wipers` | boolean | — | Wipers active |
| `lights.turnSignal` | number | — | −1 left, 0 none, 1 right |
| `aids.abs` | boolean | — | Anti-lock braking currently active |
| `aids.tcs` | boolean | — | Traction control currently active |
| `aids.esp` | boolean | — | Stability control currently active |
| `fuel.level` | number | — | Remaining fuel/energy fraction, 0..1 (C-3) |
| `fuel.rate` | number | `m3/s` | Current consumption rate (L/h ÷ 3.6e6) |

Deliberately out of scope for now: race state (`race.lap`,
`race.position`, lap timing) — recurring, but domain-specific enough to go
through the ratification process as a real first test of it.

## Event names (unratified — same process as channels)

`EventFrame` stimuli (CONVENTIONS C-10) use dot-namespaced names, ratified
by the same ≥2-game bar as channels. Candidates seen in the wild so far
(none yet two-game, none ratified):

| Name | Notes |
|---|---|
| `body.impact` | collision, direction + intensity |
| `weapon.fire` | the player's own weapon firing |
| `weapon.hit` | being hit; direction points toward the shooter |
| `explosion` | high-intensity, often sustained |
| `surface.scrape` | duration > 0 sustain window |
| `footstep.stomp` | heavy footfall (also derivable from `LegState.contact`) |

Senders facing a concept not listed: name freely, exactly as with
channels (`mech.stomp`, `space.decompress`). Reuse only exact ratified
names.
